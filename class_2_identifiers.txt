Identifiers:-
------------
Identifiers Concept is very very importance for use because of name of python.
Camel casing and Snake Casing helps alot for naming also.

A name is python is called identifier.
It can be class name or function name or module name or variable name


what is variable?

where we store or hold data, it's know as variable.

ex:- math_marks = 87


Rule to define identifiers in python:-
-------------------

1.The only allowed charcters are :-
	> Upper case and Lower case
	> 0 to 9 (digits)
	> underscore symbol(_)

2.indentifiers should not start with digits.

ex:- 


>>> a1 = 56
>>> _a1 = 56

>>> 1A = 56
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> 

3.Python is a case sensitive language, so that python identifier also case sensitive.

>>> Result = 100
>>> result
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#7>", line 1, in <module>
    result
NameError: name 'result' is not defined
>>> 
>>> Result
100
>>> 
>>> REsult
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#11>", line 1, in <module>
    REsult
NameError: name 'REsult' is not defined
>>> 

Note:- There are no length limit for python identifier, But not recommenede to use too lengthy name, Plaese follow the bussines logical name.


Casing:- Pep8


Camel Casing:- (ClassName,ModuleName and FolderName)

Use :- Upeercase and Lowercase

Every word of first char should be upper case and rest all of these are lower.

STATE BANK OF INDIA :-

StateBankOfIndia




Snake Casing:- (function name, variable_name,file_name)

User:- Lower,digits and underscore(_)

STATE BANK OF INDIA :-

all are use only lower case, in between every words use underscore(_) only.

state_bank_of_india_00108


Underscore:-

state_bank_of_india_00108 = 10  (Normal Variable)

>>single underscore in fornt of variable

_state_bank_of_india_00108 = 10 (Procted variable)

>>double underscore in fornt of variable

__state_bank_of_india_00108 = 10 (Private Variable)
