				Python's Object Oriented Programming (OOPs)


What is Class: 

⚽ In Python every thing is an object. To create objects we required some Model or Plan or Blueprint, which is nothing but class.
⚽ We can write a class to represent properties (attributes) and actions (behaviour) of object.
⚽ Properties can be represented by variables
⚽ Actions can be represented by Methods.
⚽ Hence class contains both variables and methods.


How to Define a class?

We can define a class by using class keyword. 
Syntax:
class className:
 ''' documenttation string '''
 variables:instance variables,static and local variables
 methods: instance methods,static methods,class methods
Documentation string represents description of the class. Within the class doc string is always 
optional. We can get doc string by using the following 2 ways.
1. print(classname.__doc__)
2. help(classname)
Example:
1) class Student: 
2) ''''' This is student class with required data''' 
3) print(Student.__doc__) 
4) help(Student) 
Within the Python class we can represent data by using variables. 
There are 3 types of variables are allowed. 
1. Instance Variables (Object Level Variables)
2. Static Variables (Class Level Variables)
3. Local variables (Method Level Variables)

Within the Python class, we can represent operations by using methods. The following are various 

types of allowed methods
------------------------
 

1. Instance Methods
2. Class Methods 
3. Static Methods

Example for class:
1) class Student: 
2) '''''Developed by Krishna for python demo''' 
3) 	  def __init__(self): 
		 self.name='Krishna' 
5) 		 self.age=40 
6) 		 self.marks=80 

8) def talk(self): 
9) 		print("Hello I am :",self.name) 
10) 	print("My Age is:",self.age) 
11) 	print("My Marks are:",self.marks) 



What is Object:

Pysical existence of a class is nothing but object. We can create any number of objects for a class.
Syntax to create object: referencevariable = classname()
Example: s = Student()


What is Reference Variable:

The variable which can be used to refer object is called reference variable.
By using reference variable, we can access properties and methods of object.
Program: Write a Python program to create a Student class and Creates an object to it. Call the 

method talk() to display student details


1) class Student: 
2) 
	  def __init__(self,name,rollno,marks): 
		 self.name=name 
	5) 	 self.rollno=rollno 
	6)   self.marks=marks 
7) 
8) def talk(self): 
9)    print("Hello My Name is:",self.name) 
10)   print("My Rollno is:",self.rollno) 
11)   print("My Marks are:",self.marks) 
12) 
 

13) s1=Student("Krishna",101,80) 
14) s1.talk() 

Output:

Hello My Name is: Krishna
My Rollno is: 101
My Marks are: 80
