while loops:-
-------------

if we want to execute a group statements iteratively until some condtion false, then we should ngo for while loop.

while condition:
	body/statements/expression

1.To print 1 to 10:

x = 1
while x<=10:
    print(x)
    x = x+1

 2. To print nth no of mul

n = int(input('Enter you number:-'))
x = 1
sum = 1
while x<=n:
    sum = sum*x
    x = x+1
print(sum)

3.Infinity Loop

i = 0
while True:
    i = i+1
    print('hello',i)


 H/W :-

 Find out 1 to 20 even number using while loop.



 Transfer Statememts:-
 -------------------

 i> break ii> continue iii>pass

 i> break :- we can break statement inside the loop to break the loop execution based some condition.

 for i in range(1,11):
    if i == 6:
        print('Loop break')
        break
    print(i)


s = [67,89,45,34,90,23,97]

for i in s:
    if i == 34:
        break
    print(i)


ii> continue:- We can use continue statement to skip current iteration and continue next iteration

for i in range(1,11):
    if i%2==0:
        continue
    print(i)


name = ['Abhay','Abhishek','Asish','Binay','Sudir','Goutam','Bijay','Bikash','chandra','Biswa']

updated_name = []
for i in name:
    if i[0]=='B':
        continue
    updated_name.append(i)
print(updated_name)


pass:- In our pogramming syntacally if block is required which won't do anthing then we can define that empty block with pass keyword.It's a null statement.

for i in range(10):
    pass
